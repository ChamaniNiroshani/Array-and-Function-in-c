Functions
In C programming, functions are pivotal for structuring code into manageable, reusable blocks. A function in C is defined with a specific name, return type, and a list of parameters, allowing it to perform a particular task when called. Functions promote code reusability and modularity, as they enable programmers to write code once and invoke it multiple times from different parts of the program. They can return values of various types or perform actions without returning anything, denoted by the void return type. Functions are declared before use, typically at the beginning of the code or in header files, and defined with the actual implementation of their functionality. They can be invoked with arguments, and their scope and lifetime are confined to the context of the function call, ensuring that local variables are only accessible within that function. This modular approach not only improves code organization but also enhances readability and maintainability.
